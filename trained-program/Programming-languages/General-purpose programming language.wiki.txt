In computer software, a general-purpose programming language is a programming language designed to be used for writing software in a wide variety of application domains (a general-purpose language). In many ways a general-purpose language only has this status because it does not include language constructs designed to be used within a specific application domain (e.g., a page description language contains constructs intended to make it easier to write programs that control the layout of text and graphics on a page).
A domain-specific programming language is one designed to be used within a specific application domain.
