The Charlemont Clinic was a private medical clinic in Dublin, Ireland.


== History ==
The clinic was established in 1989 on the site of the former Saint Ultan's Children's Hospital.


== Closure and sale ==
Due to decreasing revenue, the 0.38 hectare city centre site was offered for sale in 2014 at €5 million. It was purchased by U+I Group for €7.1 million and later sold to the Dalata hotel group for €11.9 million. In 2016, Dalata obtained planning permission for a 181-bedroom 4 star hotel on the site, due to open in 2018. It will form part of the Clayton Hotels chain.
