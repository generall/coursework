MAGEC (pronounced "magic"), or the Ellipse MAGEC Spinal Bracing and Distraction System, is a remote controlled spinal rod used to treat thoracic insufficiency syndrome. It is manufactured by Ellipse Technologies, Inc . MAGEC stands for MAGnetic Expansion Control. Once a surgeon implants the device, he/she can use the MAGEC External Remote Controller to distract (extend) or retract it, adjusting to the patient's growth over time. This reduces the number of repeated surgeries to lengthen the rods, and also is more cost effective.


== Intended use ==
The MAGEC rod is intended for "skeletally immature patients" under 10 with severe spinal deformities linked to thoracic insufficiency syndrome.
