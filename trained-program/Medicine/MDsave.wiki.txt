MDsave is an online platform that connects uninsured patients, health savings account holders, and high deductible health insurance patients with medical providers who offer pre-negotiated savings on medical services.
MDsave offers medical providers a way to package their services into a single bundled procedure online, and offers consumers paying out of pocket a way to comparison shop different providers. It is the world’s first transactional healthcare marketplace.
A patient searches for a treatment or procedure in a location, and MDsave returns a list of providers in that area with price, location and doctor’s ratings. A patient purchases the bundled procedure, which includes all associated fees and services, using PayPal, a credit card or a financing plan online. The patient receives a voucher to present to the doctor’s office at their first appointment. The providers get paid within six days, versus the average 60–90 days through insurance.
MDsave uses a patented technology that cross-references Medicare billing codes, procedural codes, and diagnosis codes to create an upfront price for the bundled services involved in a single treatment or procedure.
