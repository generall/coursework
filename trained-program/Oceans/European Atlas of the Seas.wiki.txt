== Purpose ==
The European Atlas of the Seas is intended for anyone interested in Europe's seas and coasts. It is developed to raise awareness and to share geographical information on the European coasts and seas, including on related human activities and relevant policies.

The European Atlas of the Seas presents maps on various topics related to the seas and coasts, to socio-economic specificities of the coasts, to marine and maritime sectors, to administration and management of the coasts and the seas. Specifically:
Geography of the seas and coasts: bathymetry, ports, land cover, hydrography, drainage basins, etc.
Natural phenomena: Sea level change, wave height, tidal amplitude, geology (coastal geology and erosion), biology (chlorophyll concentration), physics (sea surface temperature), meteorology (wind speed), marine protected areas, etc.;
Tourism: Tourist capacity, etc.
Security and Safety: European pollution response vessels, coastal defence work, etc.
People and employment: Gross domestic product (GDP), active population by sector, population density, demographic evolution, age characteristics…
Transport, energy and maritime resources: Energy and transport infrastructure projects, passenger and good transport, etc.
European governance: International conventions on protection of the marine environment, etc.
Fisheries and aquaculture: Fisheries quotas by Member States and species, allocation of European fisheries funds, catches, fleet, production, processing, consumption, employment, trade, etc.
Most of the data displayed in the atlas has been collected from European Commission departments and European agencies, especially DG MARE, Eurostat, JRC and the EEA. The information source and date appears in each map's description.
